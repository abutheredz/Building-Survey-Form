# Building-Survey-Form

# Survey Form - freeCodeCamp Certification Project

This is a responsive Survey Form built as part of the **Responsive Web Design** certification from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## 🚀 Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear labels and placeholders to guide the user.
- **HTML5 Validation**: Uses `required`, `min`, `max`, and specific `type` attributes (email, number) to ensure data integrity.
- **Diverse Input Types**: Includes radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdown menus, and text areas.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to be accessible and readable across different screen sizes.
